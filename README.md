# memory-game
A React memory game


## Description
This project is a memory game built using React. The game displays a set of images that the user can click on, and the goal is to click on each image only once. The user's score increases for each correct click and resets to zero if the same image is clicked more than once. The images shuffle themselves in a random order after each click. The game restarts when the user's score is reset.
